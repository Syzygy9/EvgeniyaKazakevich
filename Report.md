From the TAF Architecture point of view this implementarion has the following layers:
1) Test-Logic-Layer;
2) Implementation-Of-Test-Logic-Layer;
3) Work-With-Test-Data-Layer;
4) Test-Run-Layer;
5) Configuration-Layer
6) Utilities-Layer.

In this HW the following layers are absent:

1) Report-And-Logging-Layer;
2) Service-Layer.

One can include the missing layers and thereby improve the current architecture.
For example, by adding a DAO-layer for work with a database and some libraries for reporting.
